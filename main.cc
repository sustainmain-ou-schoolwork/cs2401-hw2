/*************************************************************************
    Project 2		CS2401		Spring 2022

    This is the main for your second project, a project which works with 
    the concepts of a sequence class, an internal iterator, and a dynamic 
    array.

    In order to make this main work you will need to write two classes,
    one called Song and one called Playlist. Going through the code
    below you should be able to figure out what member functions are
    needed for each. Also, since Playlist is holding dynamic memory, you 
    will need to write the Big 3 for this class.
